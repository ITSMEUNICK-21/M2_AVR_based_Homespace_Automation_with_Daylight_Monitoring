# Description
* Homespace Automation with Daylight Monitoring is an energy-efficient system that automates the turning on or off lights in a home space by detecting the human presence and daylight monitoring is added as a responsible feature in the system. 

# Requirements
* Visual Studio Code, AVR compiler, SimulIDE, Make Installer, Doxygen, Linux OS, Windows OS
# Features
* It enables detection of person or group of people within the defined range of the home space area.
* The home space area under automation can be expanded with the increase in the number of sensors and required actuators.
* Daylight Monitoring plays a vital role in contributing towards making the system energy-efficient.

# 4W's & 1H
* **What**  : Home Space Automation with Daylight Monitoring using the microcontroller Atmega328p.
* **When**  : When there is a need to automate the mechanization processes in home environments.
* **Where** : It can be incorporated seamlessly in home and business spaces.
* **Why**   : To vouch towards energy conservation, automation of individual home space and thus improving the standard of living.
* **How**   : By developing an embedded system using LDR and Ultrasonic sensor with Atmega328p being the microcontroller.
